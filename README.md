# conditional-face-GAN
Attribute conditional face generation with ACGAN in keras; GPU computation of FID and attribute metrics.

`attribute_conditional_gan.ipynb`  
is a self contained notebook for the training of models with different image resolution and number of attributes .

`evaluate_GAN.ipynb`  
keeps the code for evaluation of trained models and plotting images with relative attributes.

`GAN_Attribute_Classifiers.ipynb`
has the code for training the MobilenetV2 attribute classifiers used to evaluate the GAN models with Accuracy and F1 score.
