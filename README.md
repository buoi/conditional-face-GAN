# conditional-face-GAN
Attribute conditional face generation with ACGAN in keras, FID, attribute accuracy and f1 scores logged fast at each epoch

`attribute_conditional_gan.ipynb`  
is a self contained notebook for the training of different #attributes and resolution models

`evaluate_GAN.ipynb`  
keeps the code for evaluating metrics on trained models and plotting images with relative attributes

`GAN_Attribute_Classifiers.ipynb`
has the code for training the MobilenetV2 attribute classifiers used to evaluate the GAN models with Accuracy and F1 score.
